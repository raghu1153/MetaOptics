This folder contains the fdtd data for various wavelengths. 

These data files are obtained from literature.

#Instructions on using the data in this folder

1. For every wavelength there are two files (.xls and .txt files)
2. The .xls file contains the FDTD dimension vs transmission phase in the first and second columns.
3. The .txt file contains the other geometric and material parameters necessary for fabrication process.
4. You can run MetaOptics and chose "Upload my data" option and upload the .xls files and create any design you wish.

#Request

Users are requested to post their own FDTD data files so that the repository can grow in time and overtime we can find design file for any wavelength of interest.
